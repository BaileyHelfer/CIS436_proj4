# DogInfo App

## Introduction
Welcome to our Android Development app! This app was created to help users find out more information about their favorite dog breeds. The app is built using Android fragments and the Java programming language.

## Features
Our app has two tabs that are separated into two different fragments:

- DOGS: This tab is a list of images containing different dog breeds. Upon clicking on an image of a dog, you will be sent to the DOGINFO tab.

- DOGINFO: This tab displays some information about the selected dog breed, including its breed, lifespan, and temperament. You can also click back to the DOGS tab and select a different dog breed.

## Lessons Learned
Through the development of this app, we learned how to use Android fragments and the Java programming language to build a functional and user-friendly app. We also learned about the importance of user experience and the need to make sure that the app is easy to navigate and understand.
